title: Should it be YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-DD-MM? My Thoughts
published: 2013-08-27

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.
